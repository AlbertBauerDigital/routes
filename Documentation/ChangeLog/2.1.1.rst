#. Refine Csrf by leveraging FormProtectionFactory

    Before we used just user session identifier as a CSRF token which
    is considered as sensitive information disclosure.

    So now we've changed it. No action is required from end user.
    Csrf token gets regenerated for each page reload in :file:`Production mode`.

#. Avoid middleware execution

    I've had a community request to change it from :file:`debug` to something else as debug
    key getting used for different reasons as well.
    Those who use this feature in development mode,
    please use :file:`disableRoutesMiddleware` instead.

    .. code-block:: php

        // Before
        $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['debug'] = true;

        // Now
        $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['disableRoutesMiddleware'] = true;

#. Simplify VerifyAdminBackendSession
