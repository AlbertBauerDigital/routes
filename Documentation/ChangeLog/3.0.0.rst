.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. [Breaking] JavaScript based sugar has been removed

    We have removed axios and Routes.js.
    If you still using any of these, just copy it from previous release
    and connect the assets in your *theme* extension.

#. PHP 8.0 support

    The codebase has been refactored to support php 8.0.
    We also have an intention to fix future issue for 8.1.

#. Caching

    Some users were facing numerous route caching issues.
    We've added some additional <do-not-cache> parameters in this release
    which solves some of the problems.

#. Remove *facade* and *carbon* dependencies

    Starting from now, this extension do not require any vendor dependencies,
    but only TYPO3 ^11.4.3
    If you still using any of these, the new version of *routes* works fine with them,
    just add them to your root composer.json.
