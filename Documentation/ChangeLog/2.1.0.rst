#. Respect .yaml format for root file

    In previous versions of the extension it was possible to use only **yml** file extension for your Routes root file.
    From now on it's possible to use both :file:`Routes.yml` and :file:`Routes.yaml` as well.

#. Restore session middleware

    Starting from TYPO3 10.4.10 sessions hashing has been changed and due to this :file:`VerifyCsrfToken` and :file:`VerifyAdminBackendSession`
    middleware were broken.
    We fixed that problem and now should work as before.

#. Custom name for root file

    Some of you have asked about having an option to use custom name for root Routes file.
    As a default we still keep :file:`Routes`
    But now you also have an option to change it.

    .. code-block:: php

        // Default
        $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['routes']['routesFileName'] = 'Routes';

        // You can change to any name...
        $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['routes']['routesFileName'] = 'ApiRoutes';

#. Custom paths

    For example, you have an extension **blog** and wanna use api routes.
    Now it's possible to put your routes file anywhere you want inside your extension,
    but you need to add that custom path.

    .. code-block:: php

        $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['routes']['additionalPathList'] = [
            999 => '/var/www/html/public/typo3conf/ext/blog/Configuration/API/Endpoints.yaml'
        ];

#. Plugin with multiple controllers

    Thanks to **Devid Messner** now you guys are able to user one plugin with more than
    one controller inside. Might by handy.
